message: "Many thanks for the guide Moshe! very useful when porting commands.\r\n\r\nA couple of questions: \r\n- Is there any particular way to move the dt() function to a $this->t() or something like that?\r\n- Do the $options array replace drush_get_option?\r\n- Has drush_print_table() been replaced by something else?"
