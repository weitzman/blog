message: "While attempting to port an older global drush command, I followed the porting instructions which generated the necessary Drush code, but I was getting a `CommandNotFoundException` when attempting to run the command. The command was not discovered by drush because it wasn't part of an enabled module.\r\n\r\nIf this is your issue, either create a module_name.info.yml file manually, or run drush generate module, then enable the module in question."
