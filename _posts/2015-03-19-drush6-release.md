### Drush 6 Release


The [Drush team](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/graphs/contributors) is thrilled to announce [the release of Drush 6](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases/tag/6.0.0). Full release notes are there. 

The highlight of Drush 6 is the new [outputformat system](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/8.x-6.x/docs/output-formats.html). You can now request Drush output in easily parsed formats like json, csv, yaml etc.

Please come to [our lab at Drupalcon Prague](https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/drush-optimizations-your-development-workflow) for in-depth discussion and hand-on learning about Drush 6.

Note: if you are using Drupal 8, you should stick with a frequently updated clone of master branch. Drush 6 supports Drupal 6+7 but not Drupal 8.

### Drush Project Moves to Github


The Drush project has [moved to Github](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush). Update your clones! 

See our [wiki page](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/wiki/Migration-From-Drupal.org) which details the motivations and details surrounding this move.
