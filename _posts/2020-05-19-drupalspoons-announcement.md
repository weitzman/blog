Hi friends. I'm very excited about DrupalSpoons, and would love you to give it a try. DrupalSpoons is a model and a movement. It shows how great development for Drupal Contrib modules can be. DrupalSpoons is a particular configuration of groups and projects built at Gitlab.com. DrupalSpoons offers Issues, Merge Requests (same as PRs), and CI to Contrib projects. It uses zero custom code (except for the issue migration), since I have no special access to gitlab.com.

Please read its [README.md](https://gitlab.com/drupalspoons/webmasters/-/blob/master/) and click through the many links there. There you will learn the goals of the project, and more about its implementation. Devel and KeyCDN modules are now developed on DrupalSpoons. For example, [observe that all of Devel's open issues were migrated](https://gitlab.com/drupalspoons/devel/-/issues).

If you maintain a Contrib module, please consider moving it to DrupalSpoons. If you are a contributor, open a "Move to DrupalSpoons" issue for your favorite module. We can be done with rolling and [re-rolling](https://weitzman.github.io/blog/code-syntax) patches like its 1999. If we get enough momentum, I'm hoping that the DA will adopt a similar approach for its Gitlab instance and all projects can move back to git.drupalcode.org.

If you like my proposal, please [retweet](https://twitter.com/weitzman/status/1262775567386136577?s=20) and [join](https://gitlab.com/drupalspoons/webmasters/-/blob/master/docs/onboarding_user.md)! I led prior movements in Drupal like [groups.drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2007-01-03/groupsdrupalorg-launches-on-drupal-5) and [#D7CX pledge](https://web.archive.org/web/20140726220349/http://cyrve.com/d7cx), and [Drupal Code of Conduct](https://groups.drupal.org/dcoc). These movements only succeed with early _vocal_ support.

To discuss this blog post and DrupalSpoons in general, lets use [this issue](https://gitlab.com/drupalspoons/webmasters/-/issues/23) or [#drupalspoons](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C013MP4UKC0) on Drupal Slack. Please bring your most positive self :)

P.S. I never set out to build a Drupal project platform. A Devel co-maintainer asked me to fix our Travis tests. I did so on Gitlab.com and it Corona-spiralled from there.
